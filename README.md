# Cassanity

Layer of goodness on top of cassandra-cql so you do not have to write CQL strings all over the place.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'cassanity'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cassanity

## Usage

```ruby
require 'cassanity'

# client does the heavy lifting of setting up a cassandra cql database instance,
# a cassanity executor for that database, and a cassanity connection
client = Cassanity::Client.new

# get keyspace instance
keyspace = client[:my_app]

# tell client to use keyspace for future queries
keyspace.use

# schema for apps column family
apps_schema = Cassanity::Schema.new({
  primary_key: :id,
  columns: {
    id: :text,
    name: :text,
    created_at: :timestamp,
  },
  with: {
    comment: 'For storing apps',
  }
})

# get instance of column family with name and schema set
apps = keyspace.column_family({
  name: :apps,
  schema: apps_schema,
})

# create column family based on name and schema
apps.create

# insert row
apps.insert(data: {
  id: '1',
  name: 'GitHub.com',
  created_at: Time.now,
})

# update name for row
apps.update(set: {name: 'GitHub'}, where: {id: '1'})

# delete row
apps.delete(where: {id: '1'})

# truncate column family (remove all rows, still can add new stuff)
apps.truncate

# drop column family (no more inserting into it, it is gone)
apps.drop
```
